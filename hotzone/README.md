# HotZone
An application to cluster infections and diseases

## Instructions

1) Inside the Project Folder, run <code>pip install --user pipenv</code>
2) Run <code>python -m pipenv install django ~=3.1.2</code>
3) Run <code>python -m pipenv shell</code>

#Limitations
As specified in Spring 1, our tracer bullet application of HotZone supports the retrieval of location data through the use of the Geo Data API. However, it still does not support saving the particular location for a particular user yet. It will be improved upon in the group project once we create our database models.
